# CS156: Machine Learning for Science and Profit
## Assignment 1 - Moore's Law, MNIST Classification
In this assignment, I tested Moore's Law by creating a Linear Regression model with Scikit-Learn in Python to show how the base speed of a processor doubles roughly every two years. I also created a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to classify numbers with the MNIST digits dataset.

## Assignment 2 - Loan Approval Prediction
I used loan application data from LendingClub on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) to create a Logistic Regression classification model to predict whether or not a loan would get approved and then used this information to create a function that estimates the highest loan amount a person should apply for.

## Assignment 3 - Yosimite Temperature Model
I used Yosimite Village yearly temperature data to create Ridge Regression models with Radial Basis Functions to capture seasonal and daily temperature variations and tested the models' performance on testing data.

## Assignment 4 - Logistic Regression with PCA and LDA Classification
Here, I made four different classification models using Scikit-Learn to distinguish between images of shirts and jerseys (data from [ImageNet](https://image-net.org/index.php)). The models used are: Logistic Regression, Logistic Regression with PCA (Principal Component Analysis), Logistic Regression with 2-D LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). 


## Assignment 5 - SVM and Neural Network Classification
Here, I created 4 more classification models with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow for the shirts vs. jerseys problem: Linear SVM (Support Vector Machine), Polynomial SVM, RBF (Radial Basis Function) SVM, VGG16 Neural Network (with Tensorflow).
