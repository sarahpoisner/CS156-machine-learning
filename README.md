# CS156: Machine Learning for Science and Profit
## Assignment 1 - Moore's Law, MNIST Classification
In this assignment, I tested Moore's Law by creating a Linear Regression model with Scikit-Learn in Python to show how the base speed of a processor doubles roughly every two years. I also created a K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier to classify numbers with the MNIST digits dataset.

## Assignment 2 - Loan Approval Prediction
I used loan application data from LendingClub on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/wordsforthewise/lending-club) to create a Logistic Regression classification model to predict whether or not a loan would get approved and then used this information to create a function that estimates the highest loan amount a person should apply for.

## Assignment 3 - Yosimite Temperature Model
I used Yosimite Village yearly temperature data to create Ridge Regression models with Radial Basis Functions to capture seasonal and daily temperature variations and tested the models' performance on testing data.
